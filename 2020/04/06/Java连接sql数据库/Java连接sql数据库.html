<pre><code>Mon Apr 06 21:26:45 CST 2020 WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server&apos;s identity verification is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must be established by default if explicit option isn&apos;t set. For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to &apos;false&apos;. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.</code></pre>
